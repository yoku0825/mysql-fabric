        )

    Users willing to write information to the logging table must specify the
    subject, category and type paramters as entries in a dictionary that is
    passed to the logging function through the extra parameter.

    The subject identifies the entity that the information is referring to,
    whereas the subject classifies the entity and the type defines what has
    been reported. In the aforementioned code, the subject is the group
    identifier, the category defines that information on a group is being
    reported and the type says that a new master is being promoted.

    The following categories are supported:

    * GROUP - Defines that information is about a group.
    * NODE - Defines that information is about the Fabric Node.
    * PROCEDURE - Defines that information is about a procedure.
    * SERVER - Defines that information is about a server.

    The following types are supported:

    * START - Defines that an entity has been started.
    * STOP - Defines that an entity has been stopped.
    * ABORT - Defines that an entity has been aborted. This is applicable
              to procedures.
    * PROMOTE - Defines that an entity has been promoted. This is applicable
                to a server or group.
    * DEMOTE - Defines that an entity has been demoted. This is applicable
               to a server or group.

    It is also possible to define the reporter and reported parameters. They
    define who has reported the information and when. If the reporter is not
    set, the name of the logger used to log the call is used. If the reported
    is not set, the time when the logging information was created is used.
